                                The image I chose to showcase for this journal log is a picture I took in a shop called SOMISOMI in Elk Grove. This I think is kind of meaningful for me because I remember this was the first time I went to a new shop that just opened and tried Taiyaki with Ice Cream (a food I've always craved) with my older sister and cousins (people I enjoy going on trips with. That moment was also the comeback of my somewhat addiction for sweetness and gave me more energy to edit and give more effort to my shots for pleasure. From then on, if I have

                                the opportunity, I always take pictures of the food I liked and tried. The start of the journey of my aesthetic food photography. This image is related to the topic of my archive collection because I plan to use those said photographies to create a somewhat travel diary of things that caught my attention and everything that was interesting that happened to me. This I thought would tell symbolize more about me, because it shows my style and techniques when it comes to my creativity and passion as a designer and artist.

                                This image was captured by one of my peers, and just by looking at it, I can infer that the image is a cat they owned, a cat that they really adore and care about based on the setup of the photo, as everything about the picture of the cat is appealing (the pose, the angle etc.) also adding the fact that because they want to showcase them. I think some of the most interesting aspects of this image derives from its overall visuals and composition. The shot was taken horizontally, matching the position of the subject, while also the subject being centered to get the focus on them, the cat. Another I though was interesting was the mutated

                            <p>
                                or monochromatic colors on the cat and the background, the fur matches the tones and moods of the background, while only the eyes have pigmented vivid color, which brings me to the other most analysis the obvious and mysterious elements. The obvious being the form and depth I believe, as the cat is the attention seeker and the tight position of the cat in the sink unifies with the enclosed horizontal spacing of the scene. The mysterious aspects, on the other hand could be the color and lighting, making me wonder whether the photograph was intentional to be like that or accidental, like a coincidence or whatnot.

To get to the point, the main feature of the article is the method and significance of evaluating an image. Seemingly, the key facet for it is to ask the question, "what is going on in the picutre?", and this is to make connections and convey some context and details through an image. Ultimately, the article offered analysis

                            on what people can engaged with images, and the purpose for this is to discover the pathways to utilize images to enlighten the capability of close reading and visual thinking. By reading the article, I have learned unexplored practices to look at images in more different perspectives, considering about its possible impact and implications, not just its visual contents. I like how the article indicated how one can demonstrate their internal thoughts and actions, seeking to for more transparency and effeciency, solidfying their beliefs, in order to improve their rationality

                            and interaction abilities. I also think that the representations transmit more information than written or spoken words alone, as being able to see seems to allows for the steady growth of an individual's cognition. A website that I found as a great example for this notion is the website called "<a href="https://livingcorporate.workshopbuilt.com/podcast/liberated-love-notes/we-are-an-answered-prayer-a-wildest-dream/">Living Corporate</a>” from the <a href="Awwwards.com">"The Awwwards Website"</a>. The overall graphics and motif in the website is full of narration and interactivity within it, making me more curious as I go through it.

According to the article, Modals, Overlays, Dialog Windows are described as the element and feature in a page or application that will pop out in the foreground of the screen, over the main window, disabling the software but maintains it visible in the background. Said window was meant to capture user's attention to give out important warnings, signs, and any other information, that the user's must interact with or

To sum up, the general purpose of implementing Modals, Overlays, Dialog Windows is for user's to focus for something in any program. To achieve that, the article mentioned some of the best practices for applying the layout for the Modals, Overlays, Dialog Windows. The anatomy of said windows may need an escape hatch: to get out of it, a descriptive title: to provide context, and button: for options and actions. Ultimately, It should be limited in scope since material should fit within it or a separate tab may be necessary for a significant amount of data, employ lightbox

In conclusion, I think the article was pretty helpful to keep in mind and to be aware for the UI/UX of webpage and application designs or layout. It seems that Modals, Overlays, Dialog Windows have significant advantages, including engaging the user's attentiveness, conserving concepts or details, and simplifying the user interface. Overall, I learned that some applying Modals, Overlays, Dialog Windows is to make sure that user's are not overwhelmed and create understanding to the context into websites and mobile apps.

From what was mentioned, the key idea for developing a structure for a form page is the conversion from its UI/UX, employing specific elements that were further described in the article. To summarize, it seems that the webpage must be interactive and communicative to the users, where it is simple to understand for the audience to fill out the form with ease and make them commit until the end of it. The form should not overwhelm the

                        <p>
                            users, the format needs to be concise and direct wherein there small questions or the informations are broken down through multiple steps to avoid much scrolling, as the objective here is to make it less than more. Ultimately, it also important to provide explanations and distinguish guidelines like labels, field size, button options, placeholder texts, and such for the users to know what it is needed to be done, making it as accessible as possible for anyone. From what I learned, what is critical to do is to make the page as universal or feasible ever. I think a great example could be the "<a href="https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/schedule-vaccine">Walgreens</a>” form for
                        </p>

                            appointments, as the setup has intstructions and descriptions that also gives minimal fields where it expands as I go, making it fast and easy to answer properly. Overall, I believe the article had a valuable case and useful informations. As technology evolves so should the designing to match the credentials for individuals needs and satisfication, and the techniques and strategies should be considered and to be applied for. Finally, I think the essential element to keep in mind is the attention to detailing a webpage.
