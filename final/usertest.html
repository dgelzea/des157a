               <p>
                    For my final project, I tried to iterate my Every Picture project from being a simple page diary into a social media-like or blog-like website. My goal for my project is to narrate some snippets of my life and characteristics into an aesthetic and minimalistic web page.

                    <li>
                         Go over the webpage and see the overall design and layout of the page (observe the visibility, readability, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Look through possible interactions and feedbacks of the page and play with it (click all the links available, scroll through the pictures, read texts, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Check the responsive state of the page to see if it is working properly

                    <ul>
                         <li>
                              What does the user think of the overall concept before and after testing?
                         </li>
                         <li>
                              What does the user think about the aesthetics of the webpage? (the amount of context is enough/not enough, etc.)
                         </li>
                         <li>
                              What does the user think about the flow and interactivity so far? (hard to figure out, needs more, just right, etc.)
                         </li>
                    </ul>

               <h2>User Test 1</h2>

               <p>
                   User Tester 1 seemingly was able to go through my webpage without going through a bit problems, as they managed to figure out what was going on to the page including interactivity and feedbacks. The user thinks that my overall design works well for them. They liked how the header and footer was in the left side that made it unique than usual websites. They also enjoyed how the page is responsive and scroll bar looked different from the normal one adding more space into the viewport. 
               </p>

               <p>
                    Some suggestions that  User Tester 1 just had was to have buttons to go back and forth from each page, like adding a next button for the next page, instead of having to go back to the home page. They also suggested to have like a background music or an animation or any type of graphics when hovering to things especially to the images.

          <section>
               <h2>User Test 2</h2>

               <p>
                    User Tester 2 was apparently able to go through the webpage and managed to explore through the entire design and layout. They said that they liked the effort that I gave to the website especially with the illustrations or graphics that I included. They also like every elements perfectly matches well together along with the general concept of the page.
               </p>

               <p>
                    Just some of the things that User Tester 2 had trouble with is the amount of scrolling they need to do. They suggested to perhaps add a fixed button that automatically takes the users to the top or at least to where the back button resides. They also suggest to have a pointer that tells the user what page they are on like have a bigger title or a banner of what page they are one, something like that.

               <h2>User Tests Feedbacks</h2>
               <p>
                    With the user testing I was able to find people with new and fresh perspective on my final project webpage and was able to locate some of the problems that I may not noticed at some point. The general problem that both users encountered through the user testing is that both had trouble scrolling a lot and desired to have just a shortcut for it instead of going through the hassle. Otherwise both thought my visuals and context are enough and were engaging.

          <section>
               <h2>User Test Summary</h2>
               <p>
                    My plan to completely finalize my final version of my final project is to first consider what the user testers wanted thus making my webpage easier to navigate and yet again take out at least the hassle of scrolling down and up without a shortcut to do so. Ultimately I just need to add animations to make the interactivity and feedbacks of my webpage more dynamic.
