               <h2>Project Summary</h2>
               <p>
                    For my final, I plan to emphasize exploring narratives and images to be able to enhance users' visual and critical analysis, and to do so, I want to update my "Every Picture" page and give more content and interactivity by making it more like a blog along with adding more pictures with a bit of text to tell my stories.

               <p>
                    "<a href="https://anotherescape.com/">Another Escape</a>" and it is basically a travel journal that showcases lots of images with articles that tells some stories regarding the them that displays places and people. Another Esacape's interface is overall very minimalistic with its simple design yet also engaging in its own ways as the not only text are interactive but also the images as well which makes it more dynamic. The vibrancy of the images makes up for the monochromatic color sheme of the layout, further highlighting the visuals, and the animations (such as transform, transition, etc) for both texts and images creates calming charisma of the structure. The only problem is about its ui/ux as most time the scrolling can be a hassle due to how overwhelming the context of some posts can be, while also images can be too oversized outweighing and blocking out the visibility of the texts, especially when viewed with a smaller screen.

               <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
               <figure>

               <p>
                    "<a href="http://ourwildabandon.com/">Our Wild Abandon</a>" is primarily a travel blog that presents images with log structures like a instagram diary that talks about places and people. Our Wild Abandon's interface has an aesthetic vibe to it and eye-catching graphics, from the pastel color palette design of the texts to its mixture of warm and cool color schemes of the visuals. The sections are evenly laid out and the layout of each posts are devised consistently (title - banner - narrative - inserted image etc). The images matches and absolutely merge with the text's pigment so well, that it can be infer that this style is converying both the text and images are equally essential. The only issue that I think is about its ui/ux, as some areas may lack amount of written context to the point that images and text are not equivalent, making the images overshadow the details which may stray viewers' attention to the whole point of the posts.

               <h2>Project Goals</h2>
               <p>
                    My project will be similar to both websites mentioned in terms of concept and design. The idea is to create a narrative while illustrating it with visuals of pictures I took from my adventures that I consider meaningful for me. However, the goal of my project is not only to tell my story but to also to convey possible wisdoms to the users. This part is where it will differ to both websites, as those are just to record events. Fundamentally I want to accentuate significance of viewers' life and experiences with things by exhibiting mine, indicating that through photography one can keep a memory of said ventures. Ultimately, with my blog-like webpage I want to users to deepen their understanding with graphics possibly emphasizing the idea of visual and written analysis and exploration.

               <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
               <p>
                    For my overall design, my ideal is to still be consistent with my past web pages, making my webpage a bit aesthetic by employing graphics and details such as including vibrant and soft textured images only with somewhat cute characters of illustrations that I drew. To add into it, I also want to make the layout more minimalistic by utilizing form elements such as pastel colors, thin san-serifs fonts, and laying out contents with more spacing and value. Finally, I desire for the typography and visuals to balance each other out without one being overwhelming or overshadowing the other, by constructing the images to be the same size as some block of texts.

               <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
               <p>
                    For my general interactions, I'm most likely going to apply only subtle animations for the visual and aural feedback, and I'm probably not going to include forms, inputs, and such. The interaction will be mainly coming from hovering images, texts and scrolling through the page. The techniques or methods that will be incorporated would include fading in and out, transitioning positions, transforming scales, changing colors, and such. To maintain the minimalistic and aesthetic design, I think it is presumably best to avoid dramatic and extraordinary interplay or interactivity. As a bonus I might also contain some ongoing animations or interactions for fun, like maybe some in the header and banner.

               <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
               <p>
                    Some important experience goal I desire to achieve for my project is for viewers to sense comfort and pleasure as they go through the storytelling of my page concept. I'm hoping that the aesthetic vibes will make the page dynamic and eye-catching to capture users' attention, while the minimalistic mood of the page will offer them simplicity and ease, making them chill and to not submerge them with too many contents in just one section or whatnot. The overall objective is to somehow keep everything concise and let viewers' be a bit creative on their own to imagine the descriptions and to also to inpret pictures an such.
